# Problems Zustand Solves

Zustand addresses common React state management issues like prop drilling, unnecessary re-renders, and context loss. It also helps solve the "zombie child" problem and issues related to React concurrency. Essentially, Zustand offers a simple, fast, and efficient way to manage state in React applications, making it a strong alternative to more complex solutions like Redux for many use cases.

| Problem                        | Zustand's Solution                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Full re-renders from context  | Per-slice subscriptions only re-render what's used |
| Prop drilling through components | Direct access from any component via hooks |
| Identity mismatch of objects/arrays | Immutable state updates with accurate control |
| Lack of memoization tools     | Works well with or without React memo tools  |

#### Here's a little detailed breakdown:

- **Prop Drilling:**
Zustand eliminates the need to pass state through multiple layers of components by providing a global store that any component can access directly. 

- **Unnecessary Re-renders:**
By allowing components to subscribe only to the parts of the state they need, Zustand minimizes unnecessary re-renders, improving performance. 

- **Context Loss:**
Zustand's store is designed to avoid context loss issues, particularly when dealing with mixed renderers or concurrent React features. 

- **"Zombie Child" Problem:**
Zustand's design helps prevent issues where components that are no longer mounted (zombie children) attempt to update the state, leading to errors. 

- **React Concurrency:**
Zustand handles React's concurrent rendering features more gracefully, reducing the likelihood of errors or unexpected behavior during updates.  

- **Simplified API:**
Zustand offers a minimalistic and intuitive API, making it easier to learn and use compared to more complex state management libraries. 

- **Flexibility:**
Zustand allows you to store any type of data (primitives, objects, functions) in its state and supports middleware for adding extra functionality.
