## When to Choose Zustand

- You want **minimal boilerplate** and easy setup.
- Need **global state** without using `<Context.Provider>`.
- Prefer **hook-based access** with **per-slice re-renders**.
- Working with **React or React Native** and want a single state solution.
- Require built-in support for **middleware, persistence, or devtools**.

#### Concepts

- Re-render Optimization
Zustand is optimized to prevent unnecessary component re-renders. It allows components to subscribe only to the specific piece of state they need. This means if a component is using just one part of the store (like count), it will only re-render when count changes—not when other parts of the store update. This is more efficient than Context API, where all consumers re-render when any part of the state changes.

- Async Logic
Zustand handles asynchronous operations naturally. You can use async/await directly inside the store’s action functions. There's no need for external middleware like redux-thunk. This makes tasks like fetching data from an API simple and intuitive.  
Example:
You can define a fetchBooks function inside the store that calls an API and updates the state with the result.

✅ **Use Zustand** if you want a fast, simple, and scalable solution without the boilerplate of Redux or the limitations of Context API.
