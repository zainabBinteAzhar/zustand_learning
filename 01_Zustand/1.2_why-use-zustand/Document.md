# Why Use Zustand

Zustand (German for "state") is a **minimal, scalable, and flexible** state management library for React. 


---

### 1. Simplicity First

- No boilerplate: no reducers, action types, or dispatches.
- All logic in a single store file.
- Uses plain JavaScript functions.

```js
const useStore = create(set => ({
  count: 0,
  increase: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
}));
```

---

### 2. Hook-Based API

- Zustand uses hooks like `useStore()` to get and update state.
- Naturally fits into the React hook ecosystem.

```js
const count = useStore(state => state.count);
const increase = useStore(state => state.increase);
```

---

### 3. Global State Without Context API

- No need for `<Provider>` components.
- Components subscribe directly to the store.
- Only re-renders when used state changes.

---

### 4. Scales Well

- Works great for small and large applications.
- Supports multiple independent stores.
- Good for both UI state and business logic.

---

### 5. Efficient & Performant

- Zustand only re-renders components that use the changed slice of state.
- Shallow comparison by default avoids unnecessary updates.

---

### 6. Middleware Support

Zustand has official middleware for:

- Logging
- DevTools
- Persistence (e.g. localStorage)
- Immutability (`immer`)

---

### 7. Works Everywhere

- Compatible with **React**, **React Native**, **Next.js**, and even outside React.
