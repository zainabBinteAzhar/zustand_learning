# Zustand Learning & Implementation Roadmap

This repository contains a complete roadmap for understanding and implementing Zustand for global state management in React applications.

---
## 1: Zustand: 

### 1.1: What is Zustand?

- Overview of Zustand as a small, fast, and scalable state management library.
- How it differs from Context API, Redux, and other solutions.

---

### 1.2: Why Zustand?

- When to choose Zustand over other solutions.
- Benefits: simplicity, performance, minimal boilerplate.

---

### 1.3: The Problem Zustand Solves

- Prop drilling across deeply nested components.
- Context-based re-renders in large applications.
- Needing access to global state outside React components.

---

## 2: Prerequisites

### 2.1: React Fundamentals
- Functional components
- `useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`

### 2.2: JavaScript Concepts
- Closures
- Immutability
- Shallow comparison

---

## 3: Core Concepts of Zustand

- Creating a store
- Using selectors
- Updating state with actions
- Re-render optimization
- Store lifecycle

---

## 4: Middleware & Features

- Persistence with localStorage/sessionStorage
- Devtools integration
- Logging state updates

---

## 5: Advanced Zustand

- TypeScript support and typing the store
- Creating modular slices for large apps
- Accessing store outside React components
- Using Zustand in utility logic or services

# âœ… 15 Practice Tasks After Zustand Learning Roadmap

After completing the core learning roadmap, apply your knowledge with these structured hands-on tasks. These tasks reinforce concepts, improve fluency, and prepare you for real-world usage.

| Task # | Task Title                                      | Description                                                                 |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Build Your First Store                           | Create a basic Zustand store with 2 state values and corresponding actions. |
| 2      | Connect Store to Components                      | Read values and trigger actions in at least 2 separate React components.    |
| 3      | Refactor from Prop Drilling                      | Refactor an existing component tree using Zustand to remove prop drilling.  |
| 4      | Implement Derived UI Logic                       | Display dynamic content based on Zustand state (e.g., toggle theme).        |
| 5      | Add Persist Middleware                           | Use `persist` middleware to save state in localStorage.                     |
| 6      | Enable Devtools Middleware                       | Integrate Redux DevTools to track state changes in development.            |
| 7      | Optimize with Selectors                          | Use selectors to avoid unnecessary component re-renders.                    |
| 8      | Create a Custom Hook                             | Build a wrapper around your store logic using a custom hook.                |
| 9      | TypeScriptify Your Store                         | Convert your store to TypeScript with properly typed state and actions.     |
| 10     | Split Store into Slices                          | Create multiple domain-specific slices and combine them into one store.     |
| 11     | Use Store Outside Components                     | Access store values in utilities, event listeners, or effects.              |
| 12     | Sync Zustand with UI Themes                      | Control dark/light theme using Zustand and apply changes globally.          |
| 13     | Build a Zustand-based Counter App                | Create a clean, minimal counter app using Zustand as the only state source. |
| 14     | Create a Global Modal Manager                    | Use Zustand to control opening/closing multiple modals across the app.      |
| 15     | Document Your Store Design                       | Write documentation describing the shape, purpose, and slices of your store.|
